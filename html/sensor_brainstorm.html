            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
               A sensor is used in smartphones to detect various aspects of environments. The sensor in a phone refers to the components of the phone that can be felt by the chip, such as distance, light, temperature, brightness and pressure. These sensors are getting smaller and smaller, but the performance is increasing stronger with the cost getting lower and lower. 
               <br><br>
               What sensors are there in smartphones? 
               Smartphones typically have multiple sensors that serve various purposes. The exact number and types of sensors vary depending on the model and manufacturer. These sensors can be grouped by their primary functions: 
            <ul>
            <li>Motion and Orientations:</li>
            Accelerometer,
            Gyroscope,
            Location and Navigation,
            GPS (Global Positioning System) sensor
            <li>Enviromental Sensing: </li>
            Magnetometer, 
            Ambient light sensor,
            Proximity sensor, 
            Barometer 
            <li>Biometric Authentication:</li>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>
               Accelerometer sensor: This sensor measures the device’s acceleration along three axes. It primarily measures several types of instantaneous acceleration and deceleration. It enables features such as screen rotation, gaming and gesture recognition. 
               <br>
               Gyroscope: The gyroscope measures the device’s angular velocity and orientation, providing more precise motion tracking the accelerometer.  It is essential for applications AR, VR and accurate navigation 
               <br>
               GPS: This sensor utilizes signals from satellites to determine the device’s precise location. It enables navigation, mapping, and location-based services. 
               <br>
               Magnetometer: This sensor detects the Earth’s magnetic field, allowing the device to determine its orientation relative to magnetic north 
               <br>
               Ambient light sensor: Detects the presence of nearby objects without physical contact.  
               <br>
               Fingerprint sensor: This sensor authenticates the user's identity by scanning and matching their fingerprint against registered biometric data. It provides secure access to the device and sensitive applications. 
               <br>
               Camera Sensor(s): Camera sensors capture still images and videos. Modern smartphones often feature multiple cameras for various purposes, including wide-angle, telephoto, depth sensing, and macro photography. The camera sensor in smartphones serves a pivotal role in various functions, including face detection and authentication.
